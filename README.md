# Metch

Metch is a dapp for connecting hackers to form teams and build ideas as well as keep them informed about new hacking events.

## About

In my personal experience hacking I noticed that forming teams on discord could not be the best way to do it, Although it works I think there could be a much cooler approach rather than reading many messages all of them with different structures, for example some hackers say they want to join a team, others say they need people for their teams, others comment ideas to build, among other type of messages. Besides, we don’t know if someone is already taken for a team until we ask them. So metch comes and makes this easier.

## Objective

The objective of metch is to be the tool that all hackers use when they need to look for a team and start building at these kind of events
